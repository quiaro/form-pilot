# Form Pilot

Agentic app to make filling PDF forms effortless. Upload a PDF form and let the agent do the rest. This app uses [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) in the frontend and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/why-langgraph/) in the backend, plus other great packages listed in `pyproject.toml`.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 22+
- npm
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

#### Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Ollama

The application uses LLM models running locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
To see/change the models used, edit the `.env` file.

1. Pull models specified in `.env` file:

   ```
   ollama pull <model_name>
   ```

2. Run models before launching the app:
   ```
   ollama run <model_name>
   ```

### Run Locally

1. Install dependencies and create virtual environment with `uv`

   ```
   uv sync
   ```

2. Run the app on http://0.0.0.0:7860/
   ```
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

> If you wish to change any settings to the frontend of the app, edit `config.toml` in the `.streamlit` folder. Follow the [Streamlit configuration instructions](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration).

### Run in Docker container

1. Create the docker image from the Dockerfile

   ```
   docker build -t "form_pilot:latest" .
   ```

2. Run the docker container from the docker image. The app will run `http://0.0.0.0:7860/`.
   ```
   docker run --name form_pilot -p 7860:7860 -d form_pilot:latest
   ```

## Test Strings

A test server can be run to test specific aspects of the backend code:

```
python -m app.main
```

- Test parsing of the PDF form

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7861/api/parse_pdf_form" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"pdf_file": "app/docs/forms/form-example.pdf"}'
```

- Test the loading of supporting documents into memory (to test this, create a Word document with information related to the fields in the form)

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:7861/api/load_context  -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"document_filepaths": ["app/docs/context/info.docx"]}'
```

- Test pre-filling of a form using supporting documents

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:7861/api/pre_fill_form  -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"form_data": {"formFileName":"app/docs/forms/form-example.pdf","lastSaved":"","fields":[{"label":"Given Name Text Box","description":"First name","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Family Name Text Box","description":"Last name","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Address 1 Text Box","description":"","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"House nr Text Box","description":"House and floor","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"ewresd fdsf wr","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Address 2 Text Box","description":"","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Postcode Text Box","description":"","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"City Text Box","description":"","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"erewrs erter tertret ert ertertd fsdf ","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Country Combo Box","description":"Use selection or write country name","type":"dropdown","docId":null,"value":"ert t ert","options":["Austria","Belgium","Britain","Bulgaria","Croatia","Cyprus","Czech-Republic","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Ireland","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Malta","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","Sweden"],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Gender List Box","description":"Select from list","type":"dropdown","docId":null,"value":"Man","options":["Man","Woman"],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Height Formatted Field","description":"Value from 40 to 250 cm","type":"text","docId":null,"value":"","options":[],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Favourite Colour List Box","description":"Select from colour spectrum","type":"dropdown","docId":null,"value":"Red","options":["Black","Brown","Red","Orange","Yellow","Green","Blue","Violet","Grey","White"],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Driving License Check Box","description":"Car driving license","type":"checkbox_group","docId":null,"value":["/Off"],"options":["Driving License Check Box"],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""},{"label":"Language  Check Box","description":"","type":"checkbox_group","docId":null,"value":["/Off","/Yes","/Off","/Off","/Off"],"options":["Language 1 Check Box","Language 2 Check Box","Language 3 Check Box","Language 4 Check Box","Language 5 Check Box"],"lastProcessed":"","lastSurveyed":""}]}, "docs_data": [{"docId":"app/docs/context/david-q_info.docx__20250530185312","docType":"docx","dateCreated":"2025-05-30 18:53:12","content":"Name: David\n\nHeight: 170cm\n\nAddress: \n\nUrbanizaciÃ³n La Antigua \n\nCalle Jade, Casa #435\n\nTres RÃ­os, Cartago\n\nZip code: 30301"}]}'
